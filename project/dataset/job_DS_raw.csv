The objective is to create market sentiment indicators, in real time, on different assets traded on the financial markets, such as currencies, rates, commodities and stocks.This market sentiment is built from text analysis of exchanges on twitters and on the associated documents (study references, links to specialized information sites, links to specialized information sites, links to economists' studies, etc.) but also on the images (which contain curves) and on the videos that are referenced there.Project details: The first phase of the project was carried out over the last year, and focused on currencies and crypto-currencies, using only the analysis of texts in English. The project also studied images, and resulted in the capacity to detect curves in the image and extract the (written) information contained in these images.ElligencIA is looking for interns to step into the second phase of the project, with the following objectives (in no particular order):From a financial point of view:- Extension of the asset classes under study to include stocks, commodities and rates.- Explore the possibility of doing a sentiment analysis on the volatility of the different assets which is an important subject for all hedging instruments such as options.The main technical challenges are due to the factual structure of the tweets which are very short, but which can reference documents that are long.

Data Scientist,OROHealth,"Remote in Montréal, QC","=FRANÇAIS CI-DESSOUS=Do you want to make models that matter?Shine at family dinners explaining the work you do that they can, at last, understand and be impacted by?Hear that doctors are excited to learn that you found a new way to improve people's healthcare?Read patient testimonials that explain how much their lives are made better because of their magical doctors and nurses?If, for you, it never is about the diploma or the job, but the science and the data!If, for you, using your maths skills and your magnificent brain to build modern models and applications that serve people is more important than predicting ad prices.If for you, discovering new algorithms, new technics and new patterns is happiness in a jar, and you dream of starting something big from scratch (or almost).If you want to learn from experimented colleagues and mentors, and occasionally (very often) laughIf you want to refine the technics and practices that make data science not just a fancy job title but ultimately, O, so fulfilling.If you're ready for a challenge and wake up every day with the feeling of having something exciting to do in a domain that will help us get through any pandemic?Simply Apply...need more?...Want to know who we are?We're a young startup, with a bold AND ambitious, AND realistic goal: make health professionals adopt telemedicine with bliss.It all started 2 years ago when two out-of-residency dermatologists (Emilie and Marc-André) and Marc-André's brother (Jean-Philippe) decided there had to be a better way to care for patients. They looked around and found no such solution, so they stitched up their own. Piece by piece, they built something they could love: Dermago (dermago.ca) a modern virtual dermatology clinic. For a time, it was enough.But one day, a private clinic approached them to ask if they could, too, use it to enter the modern age. Of course, they said! yes! And Dermago grew, a bit. And then another asked. And then another. So they started to grow, more steadily each time.But then, COVID happened and they were flooded with demands. They sat down with a consultant, asked for advice, and brainstormed. Quickly, the answer was obvious: build a technology company and take all that they had learned over the last two years to build a customizable, secure, private, smart, user and doctor friendly, modern, reasonably-priced telemedicine platform.And that's what you, as a part of the Technology team, will build!...What kind of person do we need, you ask?Passionate about software and how magic it can become in the right hands: yours!Driven to make software and data science/machine learning both efficient, privacy-aware and ethicInclined to use, participate, and maybe contribute in open-source technologies and their ecosystemEntry-level or junior is ok if you have made something worth talking about: don't be shy, show us!For the more experienced, the bar will be as high as you can make it: we're a small team (for now) so, no mental shackles and asking if you can. just. do. it....What Tiks our Toks? how do you fit?We do modern telemedicine, so yeah, we are modern: remote work, cloud technologies, recent languages, Agility, DevOps and best software practices are our bread and butter. If you like to do COBOL on a mainframe, we respect that. But our joy will be different.We have the customers, the doctors love us, but we need to build the best platform for them: so better be unafraid to try stuff, write an amazing React component, scratch it for a Svelte one, or fall back on doing it server-side. The craft never stops. We'll be learning every day.We're just starting but still, our team is strong: from the technology to our product, marketing and advisors, we look for the best or we coach, mentor and grow them, prepare to become world-class, if you already are, prepare to redefine what it means...Curious about the challenges? Come tackle those:Our platform sustains all legal requirements you can throw at it: PEPIDA, HIPAA, GDPR. For us it's a baseline, we sleep soundly when the patient and doctor are the only ones to access recordsAin't no time to wait for the page to refresh: doctors and patients need it to be easy, reactive, and pleasantData grows fast, models need to be retrained, answers still need to be given in a timely manner: it is local but we will scale, prepare the Terabyte SSDSome of our users will prefer to look it up quickly on their smartwatch, others will want to be at a desk to think about it: we don't stop at any device, we serve all, whatever the format...So what's success?Elbow-hugs if you like them (it's a COVID thing now), or just hand-washed high-fivesSimple ""Thank you""s or big gesture, a startup can lead to big rewards tooYour family or friends asking you if the fantastic platform they used to care for the health of a loved one is the thing you're working onhappy doctors and happy nurses, which means happy patients, which means healthy people! everybody wins...Stuff that will help you succeed as a Data Science team member?Having done something, even if it's a spectacular university work you're proud of, we're sure there's a reason whyGood knowledge of machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their real-world advantages/drawbacksStrong grasp of statistical theory and practiceStrong programming skills in Python programming languageExperience working with ML development frameworks and libraries (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch etc.)Familiarity with application deployment using Docker, Virtual Machines, API and GCPFamiliarity with SQL or other query languages...Remote? Benefits?When it comes to where you should live, the more talented and experienced you are and the less we care.Why? Because when you start your career, we believe you should be nearer your peers, be able to sit physically down with them, and get the 60% of communication you don't get using Zoom.We do have some rules of thumb though:Be ± 3 hours timezone-wiseSpeak English and/or French.

Outside of that, the administrative and tax complication is too much (for nowAsk for an ou benefits package, this is already too long... :)=VERSION FRANÇAISE=Tu veux créér des models qui font la différence?Tu veux enfin briller aux diners de famille en parlant de sujets qui les intéresse et les touche: la santé?Entendre des Docteurs excités d'apprendre qu'on lance une nouvelle version?Lire des témoignages de patients qui racontent combien leur vie est meilleure parce que leurs Docteurs et leurs Infirmières sont juste magiques?Si pour toi, la science des données, ca n'est pas juste avoir diplôme ou un titre, mais ta science.Si pour toi, ce qui compte c'est utiliser tes talents et tes brillants neurones pour construire des modèles rigoureux et utiles, pas vendre des pubs.Si pour toi, découvrir de nouveaux algorithmes, techniques et patterns c'est le bonheur en boite, et tu rêves de commencer quelque chose d'ambitieux from scratch (ou presque)Si tu veux apprendre d'un leadership et de mentors expérimentés et occasionnellement drôles.Si affiner tes pratiques pour deployer des modèles complexes et riches qui fonctionnent c'est un challenge mais c'est, ô, combien épanouissant.Si tu est prête( e ) pour un challenge et te lever chaque jour avec la certitude d'avoir quelque chose d'excitant à construire dans un domaine qui va nous aider tous à traverser toutes les maudites futures pandémies?Il suffit d'appliquer....besoin de plus d'infos?...Qui on est?Nous sommes une jeune startup avec un plan ambitieux ET réaliste: rendre l'adoption de la télémédecine par les professionnels de santé un bonheur.Tout a commencé il y a 2 ans, quand 2 dermatologues ayant terminé leur résidence (Émilie et Marc-André) discutent avec le frère de Marc-André (Jean-Philippe) pour trouver une meilleure façon de prendre soin de leurs patients. Ils cherchent, mais ne trouvent rien qu'ils voudraient utiliser pour eux. Ils decident alors d'assembler quelque chose par eux-même. Pièce par pièce, ils rapiècent une application qu'ils commencent à aimer : Dermago (http://dermago.ca), une clinique de dermatologie virtuelle moderne.Et pour un temps, ca leur suffit. Mais quelques mois plus tard, une clinique privée les approche pour savoir s'ils peuvent, eux aussi, l'utiliser. Biensur, ils répondent ! Évidement ! Et Dermago grandit. Un peu. Puis, une autre clinique de super-infirmière fait la meme demande. Et une autre...Et Dermago grossit, de façon plus soutenu a chaque fois.Un jour, COVID arrive. A partir de là, ils se retrouvent à deux doigts d'être débordé par les demandes. Ils cherchent conseil auprès d'experts sur la stratégie et de conseillers en croissance. Après un temps de reflexion pour s'accorder sur ce qu'ils veulent vraiment construire, ils tombent sur la réponse la plus évidente: une compagnie de technologie qui incorporerait tout ce qu'ils ont appris pour livrer un plateforme de télémédecine moderne, personnalisable, sécurisée, abordable, intelligente, protectrice à l'extreme des données personnelles et avec une experience Docteur-Patient de rêve.Et ca, c'est la plateforme que tu vas construire avec le reste de l'équipe technique!...Quel genre de personnes on cherche, tu te demandes?avant tout, passionnée( e ) par le logiciel et ce qu'il peut faire entre les bonnes mains: les tiennes!!poussée( e ) par le désir de faire de la programmation et de la science des données aussi efficace, respectueuse de la vie privée qu'éthiquebiaisée( e ) dans l'utilisation, la participation et peut-être meme la contribution aux communautés open-source et leur écosystèmedébutante( e ) c'est ok, si tu as une réalisation dont ca vaut la peine de parler ensemble: soit pas timide, montres nous!pour les plus expérimentées( e ), la barre est placée aussi haute que tu la met: on est une petite équipe (pour commencer) donc aucune barrières mentales et besoin de demander l'autorisation. just. do. it....Qu'est ce qui Tiques nos Toques? ...ou tu fit?on fait de la télémédecine moderne, donc ouais, on est moderne: télétravail, infonuagique, des languages récents, l'Agilité, DevOps et les meilleures pratiques disponibles sont notre pain quotidien. Si tu aimes faire du COBOL sur des mainframes, respect. Mais notre plaisir sera ailleurs.on a déjà des clients, nos docteurs nous aiment, mais on a besoin de construire une plateforme qui dépasse leurs attentes: alors c'est mieux si t'as pas peur d'essayer des trucs, écrire un composant React impressionnant, le mettre à la poubelle pour le remplacer par une version Svelte, ou finalement le faire coté serveur. La recherche de la meilleure solution ne s'arrête jamais. Du nouveau chaque jour.on fait que commencer, mais notre équipe est déjà remplie de superstars: de la technologies aux produits, le marketing ou nos conseillers, on trouve les meilleurs où on les coach et mentor pour le devenir : prepare toi à devenir de niveau mondial, ou si tu l'es déjà, à redéfinir ce que ça veux dire...Curieux sur nos challenges? Viens donc résoudre ca:notre plateforme supporte toutes les exigences légale que tu peux lui balancer: PEPIDA, HiPaa, GDPR. Pour nous, c'est une baseline : on dort comme des bébés toutes les nuits, sachant que les données de santé des gens sont accessible juste à eux et leurs professionnels de santéain't no time for that! d'attendre que la page rafraichisse: nos Docteurs et nos Patients ont une experience facile, étonnement réactive et plaisante, on parle cacheles données ça pousse sur les disques durs comme des champignons, les modèles ça a besoin d'être mis a jour comme un Windows sans anti-virus, mais les réponses doivent quand même arriver à temps: c'est local mais ca doit scaler, prepares ton SSDcertains préfèrent avoir leur réponse rapidement sur leur montre, d'autres sur leur ordinateur de bureau: aucun appareil ne nous arrête, on sert tout le monde, dans tous les formats...Ok, c'est quoi le succès chez vous alors?Des bises de coudes si vous aimez ca (c'est un truc de COVID), ou juste des high-five avec les mains pleines d'antiseptiqueUn simple ""Merci"" ou des grands gestes, une startup peut aussi donner des grosses récompensesVotre famille ou amis qui vous demande si l'extraordinaire plateforme qu'ils ont utilisés pour prendre soin d'un proche c'est ça, votre job?des docteurs et des infirmières heureuses, ce qui veut dire des patients heureux, ce qui veux dire des gens en santé!
